## What is the game about?

[Scape Goat](http://indieboardsandcards.com/index.php/our-games/scape-goat/) is a social deduction game for 3-6 players. The players are part of a group of criminal mastermind goats who have just pulled off their biggest heist yet. The snag is: the police are onto them and the group must now conspire to pin the crime on one single player, the Scapegoat.

To frame the Scapegoat, each of the non-scapegoat players must collect a card of the Scapegoat's color into their hand and then one of them must use the Frame action to successfully place the blame on the Scapegoat.

If the Scapegoat figures out they're being conspired against, they can Go to the Cops and instantly win the game.

At the beginning of the game, each player gets to know the Scapegoat's color. The twist: one of the players' info is lying, and they are actually the Scapegoat, while they think it's someone else! This means no-one can be sure of their own identity. If the wrong player Goes to the Cops, the real Scapegoat wins!
